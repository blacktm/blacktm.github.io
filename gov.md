# My Work in Government


<a name="18f"></a>

## 18F, U.S. General Services Administration

<img src="/img/logos/18f.png">

After my year as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs, I learned a lot about what worked, and more importantly what didn't when attempting to deliver modern digital services within the vast bureaucracy of the federal government. When exploring what to do next after the fellowship, I considered many different options and opportunities, but ultimately decided to stay in government and build on our momentum establishing modern digital practices and create a permanent home for this kind of work. I wanted to make sure this movement wasn't a fluke or fad, but rather a substantive, lasting shift in culture and attitudes, something that would survive the political winds and gain broad support. On November 3rd, 2014, I started at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov).

Over the past two years, I've been fortunate to get to work with dozens of agencies and on many projects and initiatives. I've helped recruit, hire, and grow 18F, the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov), and PIF. Our digital coalition is now nearly 500 strong, full of incredible individuals who have dropped everything to serve, often making personal and financial sacrifices to do so. In May 2016, GSA [announced the creation of the Technology Transformation Service](https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2016/05/03/delivering-the-next-generation-of-digital-government/) and in October [selected a commissioner](https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2016/10/28/gsa-selects-next-commissioner-of-the-technology-transformation-service/), further demonstrating our digital efforts are on a path to permanence. We've also [gained the support of legislators](https://twitter.com/WhipHoyer/status/801166687286558720) on both sides of the aisle, and [innovation may soon be law](https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/752953487349219328). I feel incredibly proud to have largely completed what I set out to accomplish when I decided to stay in government and join 18F.

Here are the agency projects I've worked on at 18F...

**[Login.gov](https://login.gov) agency integration**, Nov 2016–Present
Currently helping lead the Login.gov integration effort across all agencies of the executive branch. The product aims to provide Americans with a single identity and sign-on experience when interacting with their government and the many services it provides. This means a simpler, more secure experience for the public, while also introducing new opportunities for government to be more collaborative, proactive, and efficient in delivering services.

**Product strategy and design research with the [Consumer eHealth Program](https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/consumer-ehealth-program) at the [Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC)](https://www.healthit.gov), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services**, Apr–Oct 2016
Led business development and engagement management. As [billions of dollars have been spent](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/10/epic-systems-judith-faulkner-hitech-ehr-interoperability) nationally to modernize health records, we sought to understand whether health IT was actually benefitting consumers of healthcare (patients, caregivers, etc.), particularly when information is needed from medical records. We conducted user research with a broad set of stakeholders to deeply understand the role of personal health information, how it flowed through healthcare settings, and ultimately the impact it had on the patient or caregiver. Our findings and recommendation were used by ONC to inform strategy for existing products and resources, and to guide policy decisions.

**Product strategy consulting with the office of the [Chief of Naval Personnel / N1](http://www.navy.mil/cnp/)**, May–Sept 2016
At the request of Naval Personnel, and in collaboration with the [Sea Warrior Program (PMW 240)](http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/PEOEIS/SWP), we assessed [My Navy Portal](http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/PEOEIS/SWP/Documents/FactSheets/FS_MNP.pdf), a new product intended to consolidate the Navy's vast human resource portals, knowledge, and applications into a unified, simple user experience. We provided an outside perspective on the state of the product and whether it was meeting sailor needs, along with recommendations to facilitate better product management, agile development practices, and human-centered design methods.

**Product strategy workshop with the [Chief of Naval Operations](http://www.navy.mil/cno/)' Rapid Innovation Cell (CRIC)**, Dec 2015<!-- Dec 15-16, 2015 -->
The CRIC contacted us about an initiative to rethink career management and progression for all sailors. We organized a two-day workshop to explore user needs, design concepts, and product strategy. After the workshop, we synthesized findings and insights to deliver an initial product vision, value propositions, user personas, a product road map, UI mockups, sample epics and user stories, and a recommendation on team structure and skill sets needed to build out the product.

**Product strategy, design research, and prototyping with the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov) for their [Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System](https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/hazardous-waste-electronic-manifest-system-e-manifest)**, June–Sept 2015
President Obama signed the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act into law on October 5, 2012, which authorized EPA to implement a national electronic hazardous waste reporting and tracking system. At the request of EPA's Chief Technology Officer, we partnered with the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response to help them devise a product strategy for the system, favoring human-centered design and agile methods. We conducted user research with industry and developed low-fidelity prototypes to validate user needs, and [worked in the open](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/07/what-exactly-do-we-even-do-all-day/) throughout for ultimate transparency with state, industry, and other stakeholders. As we validated needs and gained confidence in our direction, we created [functional prototypes](https://e-manifest.18f.gov) ([code](https://github.com/18F/e-manifest)) and further tested with stakeholders. We helped change the paradigm for how software was designed and development at EPA, as evident by the testimony given to the House Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy, where Pennsylvania Congressman Tim Murphy [said the strategy was "a great idea"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1irrYFXWJOk&t=51m49s) and hoped that other agencies would do the same.

## Presidential Innovation Fellowship

<img src="/img/logos/pif.png">

In May 2013, I was invited to join the 2nd class of [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov), a program organized by the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp) at the White House pairing top innovators with career public servants to reimagine how government can better meet the needs of the American people in the 21st century. Each of us joined an executive federal agency with a mandate to think big and bold, discover new possibilities, and ship products, initiatives, and culture change.

<!-- paragraph same as /work healthcare section -->
I joined the Veterans/Consumers Health Informatics Office, part of the [Veterans Health Administration](http://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp) that is responsible for [My Health<i>e</i>Vet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov), the patient portal available to all nine-million veterans who receive healthcare services each year. Working across the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA), I helped advance the [Blue Button initiative](http://www.va.gov/bluebutton/) to empower veterans with access and use of their personal health data ([read my white paper](/assets/va_blue_button_white_paper.pdf) to learn more). As [connected health](http://www.va.gov/health/ConnectedHealth/) initiatives were emerging at VA, I provided input and direction to ensure our efforts bridging care delivery and technology were consistent with the overall goal of providing exceptional veteran-centric health care, when and where they need it. I also coordinated an interagency and interdisciplinary team across VA and HHS to drive consensus on technologies, standards, policies, and the patient experience in viewing, downloading, sending, and connecting their health data to applications and services, and [successfully rallied](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/02/07/leading-pharmacies-and-retailers-join-blue-button-initiative) private-sector healthcare organizations to adopt the same. Along with two other fellows at HHS, we also designed and developed the [Blue Button Connector](http://bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov) to help patients across the U.S. find and access their health records, especially veterans through promoting My Health<i>e</i>Vet and sharing VA success stories.

I also found opportunities to contribute to other important veteran's issues, such as education. Supporting the [Principles of Excellence Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/27/executive-order-establishing-principles-excellence-educational-instituti), I designed and built the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/04/14/estimate-your-education-costs-just-few-clicks) ([view original codebase](https://github.com/blacktm/gi-bill-comparison-tool)), allowing veterans, service members, survivors, and eligible dependents to quickly and easily calculate their GI Bill benefits at more than 32,000 approved schools and job training programs. The tool was featured by the First Lady’s Joining Forces initiative and [on the Today Show with Dr. Jill Biden](https://youtu.be/3b7MZ1oqrvk). In the first year since its launch in February 2014, more than a million unique visitors have researched just as many educational programs. Through the use of agile and modern development practices, VA saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in initially proposed software development and infrastructure costs. Reception by veterans service organizations was also very positive (see reactions from [Student Veterans of America](https://studentveterans.org/media-news/press-releases/208-sva-recognizes-high-achievements-of-veterans.html) and [The American Legion](https://www.legion.org/careers/224432/va-releases-new-gi-bill-comparison-tool)). The success of the tool helped provide VA the latitude needed to [reimagine the veteran digital experience](https://www.vets.gov/2016/11/11/help-us-improve-vets-gov/), and was one of the first applications to get adopted by [Vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/), which has now been completely redesigned by the [USDS team at VA](https://www.usds.gov/work).

On August 17, 2015, [President Obama signed an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/17/executive-order-presidential-innovation-fellows-program) making the Presidential Innovation Fellows program a permanent feature of the federal government. (Read the White House Medium post, [_"Meet the Presidential Innovation Fellows"_](https://medium.com/the-white-house/meet-the-presidential-innovation-fellows-194dec20442b#.3o9267y6f).) I was honored to be mentioned by name in the [fact sheet accompanying the executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/17/fact-sheet-president-obama-signs-executive-order-making-presidential), along with the two projects I personally worked on: the Blue Button initiative and the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

## U.S. Navy

<img src="/img/logos/navy.png">

After graduating high school in 2002, I joined the [U.S. Navy](http://www.navy.mil) to be an [Information Systems Technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems_technician_(United_States_Navy)), serving four years on active duty, rising to rank of [Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_officer,_second_class), and continuing as a reservist until June 2011. 

During my service, I was awarded the [Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_Medal) for outstanding professional achievement at the [Naval War College](https://www.usnwc.edu) by President Rear Admiral Jacob L.
