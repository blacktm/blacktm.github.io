title: Starting my game dev journey ðŸ‘¾

Hi there! I'm Tom, and I'll be doing some game development and sharing my progress here. I'm not a professional or anything â€” I primarily make software for the web, but have a side interest in graphics and game programming.

I've always been interested in _playing_ games, but making them myself is something new. For the past few years, I've been building a native 2D graphics engine from scratch, called [Simple 2D](https://github.com/simple2d/simple2d). It's written in C, uses OpenGL for rendering, and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) to create windows, interact with input devices, and handle media like images and audio. Simple 2D was designed to be a, well, simple and easy-to-use tool for creating native, cross-platform 2D applications and games. However, using C and Simple 2D directly to build games is a bit too primitive, and not very natural. As a web developer, Ruby is my language of choice, and so I also built [Ruby 2D](http://www.ruby2d.com) to bring the same level of natural expressiveness and joy to game development. Ruby 2D _uses_ Simple 2D under the hood. (I actually built Ruby 2D first, then extracted its native C extension which would eventually become Simple 2D.) In addition to having cross-platform _native_ applications, I also wanted them to run on the web, so I ported Simple 2D to JavaScript (see [Simple2D.js](https://github.com/simple2d/simple2d.js)) and built a path for Ruby 2D apps to get compiled with [Opal](http://opalrb.com). Finally, I wanted the ability to compile the whole thing down to native code for easy packaging and distribution, so I incorporated [MRuby](http://mruby.org) as well. If you want to learn more about this crazy journey, check out [my RubyConf talk](/rubyconf).

Building Simple 2D and Ruby 2D have been extremely rewarding in and of itself. I've learned a ton about how graphics work, building cross-platform libraries, and enjoyed the opportunity to share my experiences. That said, these are just tools and they exist to build _other things_. I've made a couple things, like these [N-body simulations](https://github.com/blacktm/nbody) ðŸŒŒ, but I'm ready to start working on a real, actual game.

Building a game will provide a nice creative outlet, which I don't always get at work (doing government tech). I'm looking forward to making some pretty pixels and composing music. I also want to build something where I can incorporate my own style of humor (I greatly enjoyed games like [Happy Wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Wheels) for the record ðŸ¤£). While I don't have lofty goals, I do hope it's at least good enough to publish on an app store (and it's fine if it doesn't make any money). Oh, and I want to make it both playable on mobile _and_ using a traditional game controller ðŸŽ®, ideally.

As for the _type_ of game, I've thought about a few different concepts. Growing up in the 90's, I got to live during the heyday of the 16-bit consoles. We didn't own a Sega Genesis, but rather a made it a ritual of renting one at the local video store when visiting the grandparents. My brother and I would stay over the weekend, renting games like [Streets of Rage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage) and [Road Rash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash) (convincing our poor grandma that our parents would totally approve of the content). Those games (also [Rampage on the NES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LEHAQq4eKk)) were so hilariously destructive, full of action, and fun for casual play or longer if you were up for it. I imagine creating a game inspired by the past, capturing the essence of what made them so fun to play, while being solidly modern. It's a foggy vision at the moment, but through some rapid prototyping, I hope to gain clarity and direction.

That's all for now. Next time, I'll show off some game prototypes.
