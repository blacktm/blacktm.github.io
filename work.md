# My Work

My mission is to help industries which have not fully benefitted from the digital technology revolution begin to embrace modern methods and practices so they are prepared and able to do so. I devise strategies, organize teams, conduct design research, generate prototypes, establish development practices, build products and services, and make delivery possible. So far, my focus has been on government, healthcare, and education.

## Government

<!-- Gov theme idea: https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/03/05/weekly-address-sxsw -->

I believe the American people deserve a government that is agile, efficient, and responsive to their needs. Government should provide digital-by-default public services in the 21st century, designed with the people they're intended to serve at the center, and not the bureaucracy. Furthermore, these digital services should work seamlessly, just as well as those we've come to expect in the consumer space. If we are to create and maintain an effective democracy and equitable society, it is essential that we leverage modern technologies and practices.

Since 2013, I’ve been in the federal government helping build and grow our [digital coalition](https://www.fastcompany.com/3046756/obama-and-his-geeks), serving first as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](/gov#pif) at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs, and now as a product strategist and consultant with [18F](/gov#18f), a digital services team within the new Technology Transformation Service at the U.S. General Services Administration. From 2002 to 2011, I served in the [U.S. Navy](/gov#navy), both active and reserve, as an Information Systems Technician at the Naval War College, aboard the USNS SUPPLY (T-AOE-6), and with the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office.

## Healthcare

Our healthcare system in the United States is far from what it could be, in delivery, outcomes, and cost. I believe design thinking and the proper application of digital technologies will be critical in creating the human-centered and value-based system we all envision.

Since 2010, I've been a healthcare entrepreneur, consultant, software developer, and designer. While working in government, I've been an advisor to the [Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT](https://www.healthit.gov) at the Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS), most recently leading a product strategy and design research engagement with the [Consumer eHealth Program](/gov#18f-onc-ceh) and as a member of the review panel for the [Provider User Experience Challenge](http://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2016/07/18/onc-announces-phase-1-winners-consumer-health-data-aggregator-and-provider-user-experience.html).

As a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](/gov#pif), I joined the Veterans/Consumers Health Informatics Office, part of the [Veterans Health Administration](http://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp) that is responsible for [My Health<i>e</i>Vet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov), the patient portal available to all nine-million veterans who receive healthcare services each year. Working across the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA), I helped advance the [Blue Button initiative](http://www.va.gov/bluebutton/) to empower veterans with access and use of their personal health data ([read my white paper](/assets/va_blue_button_white_paper.pdf) to learn more). As [connected health](http://www.va.gov/health/ConnectedHealth/) initiatives were emerging at VA, I provided input and direction to ensure our efforts bridging care delivery and technology were consistent with the overall goal of providing exceptional veteran-centric health care, when and where they need it. I also coordinated an interagency and interdisciplinary team across VA and HHS to drive consensus on technologies, standards, policies, and the patient experience in viewing, downloading, sending, and connecting their health data to applications and services, and [successfully rallied](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/02/07/leading-pharmacies-and-retailers-join-blue-button-initiative) private-sector healthcare organizations to adopt the same. Along with two other fellows at HHS, we also designed and developed the [Blue Button Connector](http://bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov) to help patients across the U.S. find and access their health records, especially veterans through promoting My Health<i>e</i>Vet and sharing VA success stories.

Previously, I've also been...

- The creator of [BlueButton.js](http://blue-button.github.io/bluebutton.js) ([code](https://github.com/blue-button/bluebutton.js)), an open-source JavaScript library for developers to navigate complex healthcare data and empower patients through access and comprehension of their personal health record. This library and accompanying front-end framework was developed in response to the [Health Design Challenge](http://healthdesignchallenge.com) (watch Ryan Panchadsaram talk about the challenge and this framework in his [TEDMED 2013 talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mv8UzJlUtw&t=5m17s)<!-- Also http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=91690 -->).
- Co-organizer of [Health Devs NYC](https://www.meetup.com/HealthDevsNYC/) (2012), New York City's largest healthcare developer meetup with over 1,200 members.
- "Floating Founder" at [Blueprint Health](http://www.blueprinthealth.org) (2012), where I advised all nine teams in the inaugural class, guiding them through product development, lean software design and engineering principles, and mobile and cloud-computing strategies. I gave a talk at the [Madison Health Tech meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Madison-Health-Tech/events/62122702/) about my experience and what I learned from our mentors ([view slides](https://speakerdeck.com/blacktm/three-months-in-a-healthcare-accelerator)).
- Co-founder of [ScioMD](http://www.sciomd.com) (2011), where I designed and developed a cloud-based, medical laboratory reporting and analytics service allowing patients to finally understand and act on their lab results.
- Developer with [Healthfinch](http://www.healthfinch.com) (2010), where I prototyped an iPad app to administer the [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parkinson's_disease_rating_scale) questionnaire, allowing patients with the motor disability to complete the long, tedious paper form on a tablet with ease.

## Education

Technology is rapidly shaping the world around us, and I believe everyone should have access to these digital technologies and the opportunity to learn how they work, so they can benefit from them both economically and socially. I continually look for opportunities to teach and contribute in order to close the gap.

Most recently, I helped launch the White House's [TechHire](https://www.whitehouse.gov/techhire) initiative with the National Economic Council and Office of Science and Technology Policy. I also had the honor of co-organizing the 2015 [#HourOfCode at the White House](https://twitter.com/blacktm/status/673893699164704769).

While living in New York City, I was a spring 2013 volunteer with [ScriptEd](https://scripted.org) at [Harlem Village Academy](http://harlemvillageacademies.org) High School, teaching web development and mentoring students. In 2012, I was part of the team at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly) to pilot the very first [Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive) course in partnership with [Incline](https://pando.com/2012/08/16/incline-plans-to-bring-veterans-to-startups-with-a-built-in-revenue-stream/), a startup bringing programming and computer science skills to veterans, and connecting them with employers eager to find candidates with the qualities gained through military service combined with their newly acquired technical skills. I also once gave a guest lecture ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/blacktm/building-web-apps-with-rack-and-sinatra)) at the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com).
