# My work

Learn about my public technology work. So far, my focus has been on [government](#government), [healthcare](#healthcare), and [education](#education).

## Government

I believe the American people deserve a government that is agile, efficient, and responsive to their needs. Government should provide digital-by-default public services in the 21st century, designed with the people they're intended to serve at the center, and not the bureaucracy. Furthermore, these digital services should work seamlessly, just as well as those we've come to expect in the consumer space. If we are to create and maintain an effective democracy and equitable society, it is essential that we leverage modern technologies and practices.

Since 2013, I’ve been in the federal government helping build and grow our [digital coalition](https://www.fastcompany.com/3046756/obama-and-his-geeks), serving first as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](#pif) at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs, and now as a product strategist and consultant with [18F](#18f), a digital services team within the new Technology Transformation Service at the U.S. General Services Administration. From 2002 to 2011, I served in the [U.S. Navy](#navy), both active and reserve, as an Information Systems Technician at the Naval War College, aboard the USNS SUPPLY (T-AOE-6), and with the International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office.

### 18F, U.S. General Services Administration

<img class="fl pr3" src="/assets/img/logos/18f.png">

After my year as a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs, I learned a lot about what worked, and more importantly what didn't when attempting to deliver modern digital services within the vast bureaucracy of the federal government. When exploring what to do next after the fellowship, I considered many different options and opportunities, but ultimately decided to stay in government and build on our momentum establishing modern digital practices and create a permanent home for this kind of work. I wanted to make sure this movement wasn't a fluke or fad, but rather a substantive, lasting shift in culture and attitudes, something that would survive the political winds and gain broad support. On November 3rd, 2014, I started at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov).

Over the past two years, I've been fortunate to get to work with dozens of agencies and on many projects and initiatives. I've helped recruit, hire, and grow 18F, the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov), and PIF. Our digital coalition is now nearly 500 strong, full of incredible individuals who have dropped everything to serve, often making personal and financial sacrifices to do so. In May 2016, GSA [announced the creation of the Technology Transformation Service](https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2016/05/03/delivering-the-next-generation-of-digital-government/) and in October [selected a commissioner](https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2016/10/28/gsa-selects-next-commissioner-of-the-technology-transformation-service/), further demonstrating our digital efforts are on a path to permanence. I feel incredibly proud to have largely completed what I set out to accomplish when I decided to stay in government and join 18F.

Here are the agency projects I've worked on at 18F...

We conducted user research with a broad set of stakeholders to deeply understand the role of personal health information, how it flowed through healthcare settings, and ultimately the impact it had on the patient or caregiver.

### Presidential Innovation Fellowship

<img class="fl pr3" src="/assets/img/logos/pif.png">

In May 2013, I was invited to join the 2nd class of [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov), a program organized by the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp) at the White House pairing top innovators with career public servants to reimagine how government can better meet the needs of the American people in the 21st century. Each of us joined an executive federal agency with a mandate to think big and bold, discover new possibilities, and ship products, initiatives, and culture change.

{% include pif-healthcare.md %}

I also found opportunities to contribute to other important veteran's issues, such as education. Supporting the [Principles of Excellence Executive Order](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/27/executive-order-establishing-principles-excellence-educational-instituti), I designed and built the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/blog/2014/04/14/estimate-your-education-costs-just-few-clicks) ([view original codebase](https://github.com/blacktm/gi-bill-comparison-tool)), allowing veterans, service members, survivors, and eligible dependents to quickly and easily calculate their GI Bill benefits at more than 32,000 approved schools and job training programs. The tool was featured by the First Lady’s Joining Forces initiative and [on the Today Show with Dr. Jill Biden](https://youtu.be/3b7MZ1oqrvk). In the first year since its launch in February 2014, more than a million unique visitors have researched just as many educational programs. Through the use of agile and modern development practices, VA saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in initially proposed software development and infrastructure costs. Reception by veterans service organizations was also very positive (see reactions from [Student Veterans of America](https://studentveterans.org/media-news/press-releases/208-sva-recognizes-high-achievements-of-veterans.html) and [The American Legion](https://www.legion.org/careers/224432/va-releases-new-gi-bill-comparison-tool)). The success of the tool helped provide VA the latitude needed to [reimagine the veteran digital experience](https://www.vets.gov/2016/11/11/help-us-improve-vets-gov/), and was one of the first applications to get adopted by [Vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/), which has now been completely redesigned by the [USDS team at VA](https://www.usds.gov/work).

On August 17, 2015, [President Obama signed an executive order](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/17/executive-order-presidential-innovation-fellows-program) making the Presidential Innovation Fellows program a permanent feature of the federal government. (Read the White House Medium post, [_"Meet the Presidential Innovation Fellows"_](https://medium.com/@ObamaWhiteHouse/meet-the-presidential-innovation-fellows-194dec20442b).) I was honored to be mentioned by name in the [fact sheet accompanying the executive order](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/17/fact-sheet-president-obama-signs-executive-order-making-presidential), along with the two projects I personally worked on: the Blue Button initiative and the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

On Friday, January 20, 2017, [President Obama signed into law](http://fortune.com/2017/01/21/obama-last-act/) H.R. 39, the TALENT Act, or "Tested Ability to Leverage Exceptional National Talent Act of 2017," which codifies the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program to "enable exceptional individuals with proven track records to serve time-limited appointments in executive agencies to address some of the Nation's most significant challenges."

### U.S. Navy

<img class="fl pr3" src="/assets/img/logos/navy.png">

After graduating high school in 2002, I joined the [U.S. Navy](http://www.navy.mil) to be an [Information Systems Technician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems_technician_(United_States_Navy)), serving four years on active duty, rising to rank of [Petty Officer 2nd Class (E-5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_officer,_second_class), and continuing as a reservist until June 2011.

During my service, I was awarded the [Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_Medal) for outstanding professional achievement at the [Naval War College](https://www.usnwc.edu) by President Rear Admiral Jacob L. Shuford, and received a Flag Letter of Commendation and three Flag Letters of Appreciation from presidents Rear Admiral Jacob L. Shuford and Rear Admiral Ronald A. Route. For providing disaster relief during Hurricane Katrina and Rita aboard the [USNS SUPPLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Supply_%28T-AOE-6%29), I was awarded the [Humanitarian Service Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_Service_Medal) and [Meritorious Unit Commendation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritorious_Unit_Commendation). From 2003 to 2005 while at [Naval Station Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Station_Newport), I also served on the [funeral honor guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_funerals_in_the_United_States), rendering honors to veterans of WWII, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Here's a summary of the commands I was attached to and activities performed...

**International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office (ISMERLO), U.S. Navy Reserve**
December 2009—June 2011
_ISMERLO assists in the global coordination of submarine search and rescue operations._
Maintained a web-based international coordination tool used by participating NATO submarine operating nations to respond with rescue resources and systems in the event of a submarine incident or disaster.

**USNS SUPPLY (T-AOE-6), Military Sealift Command**
May 2005—June 2006
Activated and maintained tactical voice and data circuits used during replenishment-at-sea events, CVN ammunition transfers, and tactical maneuvering exercises. Handled Top Secret communications security material with zero discrepancies. Provided aid during Hurricane Katrina and Rita.

**U.S. Naval War College, Newport, RI**
January 2003—May 2005
Provided mid-career level officers of all services, civilian federal agencies, and international naval officers with technical resources and training for their postgraduate programs.


## Healthcare

Our healthcare system in the United States is far from what it could be in delivery, outcomes, and cost. I believe design thinking and the proper application of digital technologies will be critical in creating the human-centered and value-based system we all envision.

Since 2010, I've been a healthcare entrepreneur, consultant, software developer, and designer. While working in government, I've been an advisor to the [Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT](https://www.healthit.gov) at the Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS), most recently leading a product strategy and design research engagement with the [Consumer eHealth Program](#18f-onc-ceh) and as a reviewer for the [Provider User Experience Challenge](http://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2016/07/18/onc-announces-phase-1-winners-consumer-health-data-aggregator-and-provider-user-experience.html).

As a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](#pif), {% include pif-healthcare.md %}

Previously, I've also been...

- The creator of [BlueButton.js](http://blue-button.github.io/bluebutton.js) ([code](https://github.com/blue-button/bluebutton.js)), an open-source JavaScript library for developers to navigate complex healthcare data and empower patients through access and comprehension of their personal health record. This library and accompanying front-end framework was developed in response to the [Health Design Challenge](http://healthdesignchallenge.com) (watch Ryan Panchadsaram talk about the challenge and this framework in his [TEDMED 2013 talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Mv8UzJlUtw&t=5m17s)<!-- Also http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=91690 -->).
- Co-organizer of [Health Devs NYC](https://www.meetup.com/HealthDevsNYC/) (2012), New York City's largest healthcare developer meetup with over 1,200 members.
- "Floating Founder" at [Blueprint Health](http://www.blueprinthealth.org) (2012), where I advised all nine teams in the inaugural class, guiding them through product development, lean software design and engineering principles, and mobile and cloud-computing strategies. I gave a talk at the [Madison Health Tech meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Madison-Health-Tech/events/62122702/) about my experience and what I learned from our mentors ([view slides](https://speakerdeck.com/blacktm/three-months-in-a-healthcare-accelerator)).
- Co-founder of [ScioMD](http://www.sciomd.com) (2011), where I designed and developed a cloud-based, medical laboratory reporting and analytics service allowing patients to finally understand and act on their lab results.
- Developer with [Healthfinch](http://www.healthfinch.com) (2010), where I prototyped an iPad app to administer the [Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parkinson's_disease_rating_scale) questionnaire, allowing patients with the motor disability to complete the long, tedious paper form on a tablet with ease.

## Education

Technology is rapidly shaping the world around us, and I believe everyone should have access to these digital technologies and the opportunity to learn how they work, so they can benefit from them both economically and socially. I continually look for opportunities to teach and contribute in order to close the gap.
