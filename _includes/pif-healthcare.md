I joined the Veterans/Consumers Health Informatics Office, part of the [Veterans Health Administration](http://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp) that is responsible for [My Health<i>e</i>Vet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov), the patient portal available to all nine-million veterans who receive healthcare services each year. Working across the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA), I helped advance the [Blue Button initiative](http://www.va.gov/bluebutton/) to empower veterans with access and use of their personal health data ([read my white paper](/assets/va_blue_button_white_paper.pdf) to learn more). As [connected health](http://www.va.gov/health/ConnectedHealth/) initiatives were emerging at VA, I provided input and direction to ensure our efforts bridging care delivery and technology were consistent with the overall goal of providing exceptional veteran-centric health care, when and where they need it. I also coordinated an interagency and interdisciplinary team across VA and HHS to drive consensus on technologies, standards, policies, and the patient experience in viewing, downloading, sending, and connecting their health data to applications and services, and [successfully rallied](https://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/blog/2014/02/07/leading-pharmacies-and-retailers-join-blue-button-initiative) private-sector healthcare organizations to adopt the same. Along with two other fellows at HHS, we also designed and developed the [Blue Button Connector](http://bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov) to help patients across the U.S. find and access their health records, especially veterans through promoting My Health<i>e</i>Vet and sharing VA success stories.
